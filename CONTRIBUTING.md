# Contributing to Glass Analytics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Glass Analytics! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this WordPress plugin and explains our workflow between GitHub and WordPress.org's SVN repository.

## Plugin Documentation Management

### README Files

We maintain two different README files for different purposes:

1. **readme.txt** - The WordPress.org plugin repository requires this specific format
2. **README.md** - GitHub uses this for repository documentation

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only edit the `readme.txt` file! The `README.md` file is automatically generated.

We use GitHub Actions to automatically convert `readme.txt` to `README.md` whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. This ensures both files stay in sync without manual intervention.

## Deployment Process

### GitHub to WordPress.org SVN

We use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the plugin to WordPress.org's SVN repository when a new tag is pushed. This is how the process works:

1. **Development happens on GitHub**:
   - Make your changes and commit them to your branch
   - Create a pull request to the main branch
   - Once approved and merged, your changes will be in the main branch

2. **Release Process**:
   - Update the version number in both `glass-analytics.php` and `readme.txt`
   - Add a changelog entry in `readme.txt` under the "Changelog" section
   - Commit these changes to the main branch
   - Create and push a new tag matching your version number:
     ```bash
     git tag 1.2.0
     git push origin 1.2.0
     ```
   - The GitHub Action will automatically deploy the new version to WordPress.org SVN

3. **What the Action Does**:
   - Checks out the code at the tagged version
   - Deploys it to the WordPress.org SVN repository
   - Handles assets in the `.wordpress-org` directory (if present)
   - Creates a new version in the WordPress.org repository

### File Filtering for SVN

To ensure only relevant files get deployed to WordPress.org:

1. We use a `.distignore` file to specify which files and directories should NOT be included in the SVN deployment
2. The following are automatically excluded:
   - GitHub-specific files (`.github/`, workflows, etc.)
   - Development files (`.git/`, package.json, webpack configs, etc.)
   - Build artifacts not needed for production
   - This CONTRIBUTING.md file and README.md (as readme.txt is used by WordPress.org)

### Understanding Plugin Assets vs. WordPress.org Assets

There are two different types of "assets" in WordPress plugin development:

1. **Plugin Assets** (`assets/` directory):
   - These are files used by the plugin itself
   - CSS, JS, images used in the admin or frontend
   - These files WILL be included in the plugin deployment
   - Example: `assets/glass-admin.css`, `assets/images/glass-icon.svg`

2. **WordPress.org Repository Assets** (`.wordpress-org/` directory):
   - These are files used by the WordPress.org plugin repository
   - Icons, banners, and screenshots shown on your plugin's page
   - These will be moved to the SVN `assets/` directory (not bundled with the plugin)
   - Example: `.wordpress-org/banner-772x250.jpg`, `.wordpress-org/icon-256x256.png`

The GitHub Action handles these two asset types differently:
- Regular plugin assets in `assets/` are deployed with the plugin code
- WordPress.org repository assets in `.wordpress-org/` are moved to the SVN `assets/` directory

### Manual SVN Deployment (if needed)

If you need to manually deploy to WordPress.org SVN:

1. Check out the SVN repository:
   ```bash
   svn checkout https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/glass-analytics/
   ```

2. Copy the current plugin files to the `trunk` directory (excluding files in `.distignore`)

3. For new releases, copy the `trunk` to a new tag directory:
   ```bash
   svn cp trunk tags/1.2.0
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   svn ci -m "Release 1.2.0"
   ```

## Code Guidelines

- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Ensure your code passes WordPress plugin checks
- Update version numbers in both `glass-analytics.php` and `readme.txt`
- Update the changelog in `readme.txt` with each version change

## WordPress.org Repository Assets

WordPress.org repository assets should be placed in the `.wordpress-org` directory:

- `banner-772x250.jpg` - Plugin banner for WordPress.org
- `icon-256x256.png` - Plugin icon for WordPress.org
- `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, etc. - Screenshots shown on the plugin page

These assets will be automatically deployed to the WordPress.org SVN repository's `assets` directory and will be displayed on your plugin's page on WordPress.org.
